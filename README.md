To-do List


Hey guys, thanks for giving me this challenge. I am turning this in but still am having some difficulty getting it to function the way I want. If I had more time I could fiddle with it longer but I think I am at my wits end for the moment. I do have a mockup that is using repeaters in Axure to demonstrate the concept: Brendon.attebury@gmail.com

Here are some issues I was unable to solve or had inadequate knowledge to proceed given an adequate timeframe.

1.	I could not get the input field to expand with the containing form <div>. When I contracted the window in responsive view to 320x480 for iphone my button kept being pushed down a line. 
2.	Also input ID: “new-todo” I couldn’t get to widen with the containing div even when I had the fields width at 95% which left room for the button the containing div would grow but the input field would not expand with it. I was very frustrated over that one and still would like to figure that out. 
3.	If there is a way to send an input and bring back a result using the browser storage I could not figure it out so I turned my sights to using indexed DB. I pulled some code to bring back what is entered in the input field but could not for the life of me figure out how to format on the click event so it greyed the text and used a line through text decoration. Instead I was stuck with the default of it deleting the entry. This was also something I noticed from the mockups was that there was not way to delete an entry from what I could tell. Possibly a way to delete a line item would be the best approach for this design. 
4.	I had actually never done responsive so it was a challenge I am still trying to get my head wrapped around it. I understood how to add the media queries but I could not figure out how to change the text based on the break-points for the adaptive views. If it had been text and images I understood it better but as an application I was very confounded on how to call a separate css style sheet that changed text that I had referenced in the html. 

Thank you once again for giving me such a challenging problem to tackle. I am in total agreement that UX designers should code and that is why I think your approach at Cantina is really what will be expected in the future. I have a lot to learn but am looking forward to the challenge. 

Best,
Brendon
